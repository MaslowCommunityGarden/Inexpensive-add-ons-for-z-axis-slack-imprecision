![](https://github.com/MaslowCommunityGarden/Inexpensive-add-ons-for-z-axis-slack-imprecision/blob/master/mainpicture.jpg)

### Routers these fixes can be applied to:
* Ridgid R22002

### Issues addressed:
* Eliminate play in z-axis worm
* Reduce imprecision due to tilt in the connection clip between worm and router body

### Issues in research:
* Multiple drag points in z-axis and router assembly
* Modified z-axis clip can cause enough drag to rotate z-axis clip, disengaging it
